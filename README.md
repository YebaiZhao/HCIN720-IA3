# HCIN720-IA3
For the working files of assigment 3, course HCIN720

This 3D printing project is aiming for creating a hand hold box that contains the electric parts, the Photon and the battery. 
I was trying to make the case compact and comfortable in-hand. In order to do that, the circus board and the space in the box are specially designed, after 7 prototypes. A speaker and necessary code are added to the Photon, which will make a beep when the spaceship dies.

The 3D printing is time consuming, and the results are often surprising. In order to create the structure I want, I added some pillars at the front of the box to support the roof and floors in the middle. It successfully ensured that the structure can be printed mostly as the plan. Although there are still some losing trades under the bridge structure, they are cleaned by pliers.
